====== 2. Function based components ======
Created Wednesday 09 September 2020

* Used for dumb components, i.e components with no state.
* Can be represented sufficiently by a function.
{{{code: lang="js" linenumbers="True"
const App = (props) => // or ({names, ids}) =>
{
	return (
			<div>
				<h1>Function-Based Component</h1>
			</div>
	);
}

export default App;
}}}

Things to keep in mind for class based components:
1. **props **need to be kept as the parameter - they are mostly kept destructured.
2. No need of a render function. Just return the JSX object.
