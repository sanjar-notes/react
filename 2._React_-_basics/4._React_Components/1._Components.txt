====== 1. Components ======
Created Tuesday 02 November 2021

=== Why ===
State needs to be passed to the tags being rendered.

=== How ===
By passing a ''props'' argument to the component.

=== What ===
* These are different from elements.
* They are either functions or classes (with a render method) that have a ''props'' argument that contains the state.

Note: ''props'' are read only, by convention. Let the components be pure, w.r.t their ''props''.
