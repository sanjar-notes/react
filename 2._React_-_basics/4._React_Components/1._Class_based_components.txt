====== 1. Class based components ======
Created Wednesday 09 September 2020

* Used for containers, i.e components with state.
{{{code: lang="js" linenumbers="True"
import React, { Component } from "react";

class App extends Component
{
	constructor() //optional
	{
		super(props);
		this.state = {};
	}
	// alternative to contsructor - start
	state = {
	}
	// alternative to contsructor - end
	render()
	{
		return (
			<div>
				<h1>Class Based Component</h1>
			</div>
		);
	}
}

export default App;
}}}

--------------------
Things to keep in mind for class based components:
1. props are directly/automatically accessible as **this.props**
2. state may be created in the constructor, but is even without it.
3. render() method is compulsory.
