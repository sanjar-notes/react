====== 3. JSX ======
Created Thursday 27 August 2020

=== Why ===
JSX makes the code 
	* Intuitive and readable, instead of function calls.
	* Both structure and structure-related-logic are kept together.

=== How ===
Handled by Babel transpiler.

=== What ===
* Short for JavaScript XML
* JSX is //not// necessary for using React, basic JS is fine too.
* JSX is a syntactic sugar for JavaScript, and so can be stored in variables.

**Rules for JSX**
0. Like HTML except if specified otherwise.
1. Some reserved keywords are different:
	* ''className'' instead of ''class'' attribute.
	* ''htmlFor'' in HTML label tag instead of ''for''.
2. JS code is enclosed in braces {}.
3. Components must start with a capital letter. 
4. JSX is an expression too, you can store it in variables or return it.

=== About JSX ===
* JSX prevents injection attacks - everything is converted into a string before being rendered.
* JSX represents objects.
