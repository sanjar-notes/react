====== //9//. props.children in React ======
Created Sunday 06 September 2020

* All our components until now have been self closing.
* But simple closing tags are required if we want to create a view somewhere, say a scroll view.
**props.children in React**
If we create a normal closing tag, the children inside it are passed to the parents as props.children.
* So to render them, just do return <div>{props.children}<div>
--------------------
{{./pasted_image.png?width=400}} 	{{./pasted_image001.png?width=400}}
* To make such a scoll view, we need to wrap the CardList component in another component and restrict height and width of that component. 
* Also, we need to make **overfloxY:scroll**
* Code of the enclosing component.
	{{./pasted_image002.png}}
	{{./pasted_image003.png}}
--------------------
Note:
* We didn't have to change the CardList in any way
* This why React is so powerful
