====== 4. React Components ======
Created Wednesday 29 July 2020

=== Why ===
Components are universally useful in building UIs, because:
* Seperation Of Concerns
* Reusability

=== How ===
* HTML, CSS and JavaScript are combined to create components, using the React library.
* They are also combined using the React library.
So this is a 2 step process - create units then combine them.

=== What ===
* All component names should start with a capital letter(very important - CamelCase) - React generally treats lowercase elements as standard HTML elements.
* Every card exports a class or a function that returns one and only one wrapped JSX element(like a div or React.Fragment tag-for multiple components).
* Styled should be named as a component-class because CSS is included in the head tag.
* The index.js renders all the components, finally, and only it should, generally. 

It's normal to have ~100 components for a UI, because components of the UI are broken down.
