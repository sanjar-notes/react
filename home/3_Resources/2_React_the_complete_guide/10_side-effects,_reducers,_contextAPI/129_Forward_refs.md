# 129. Forward refs
Created Tuesday 06 May 2022
- [ ] in vault


- The `useRef` hooks works on HTML elements only, and not custom components.
The forward ref functionality let's one add refs to custom components too, so that they can be controlled directly (without the need of state/re-renders).
- It's rarely used.
