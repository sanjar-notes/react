# 127. Rules of hooks
Created Tuesday 06 May 2022
- [ ] in vault

- Basically, simple rules like don't use hooks inside conditionals, loops in the component function.
- To be honest, I don't think these rules should be kept in mind actively, because it's really rare that one thinks/needs hooks inside conditionals/loops or anything these rules stand for. There's not much to worry about learning these rules.
