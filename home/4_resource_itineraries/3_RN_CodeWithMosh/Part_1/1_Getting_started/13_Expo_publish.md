# 13. Expo publish
Created Tue Nov 7, 2023 at 9:08 AM

- It's common knowledge that publishing an app on marketplaces (Google Play or AppStore) is cumbersome, and impractical for development purposes.
- Saving and sharing APKs is also cumbersome.
  
Expo makes this problem of sharing and trying out apps very easy.
Using Expo Publish, you can save apps and generate shareable link to try the app.
This works on real devices too.

Of course, you'll need an Expo account, which is free.
