Created Monday 25 July 2022

[Code repo](https://github.com/exemplar-codes/reactjs-forms-user-input)

There are two ways to access user input - `ref` and `onChange`(with state). I already know this. See [onChange](https://github.com/exemplar-codes/reactjs-forms-user-input/commit/a0925ba34d508f3c3f7df1f9f3b8f7175f9e4845) and [ref](https://github.com/exemplar-codes/reactjs-forms-user-input/commit/7ba6b0a577b9009f555457a8d4e24771be89c16b).
