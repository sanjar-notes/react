- There are 3rd party libraries that help in making forms. One example is [Formik](https://formik.org/).
- An important aspect of forms in an SPA is to use `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` to store entered input, this provides good UX, i.e. even if the page is refreshed without submission the input is kept filled.
