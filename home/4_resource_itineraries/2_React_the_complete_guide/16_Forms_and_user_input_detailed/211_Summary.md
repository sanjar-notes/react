Created Tuesday 26 July 2022

- There are 3rd party libraries that help in making forms. One example is [Formik](https://formik.org/).
- An important aspect of forms in an SPA is to use `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` to store entered input, this provides good UX, i.e. input is retained even if the page is refreshed without submission.
- Another important thing in forms is pre-filling of values we already know, so that work done by the user is minimized. Example: WorkDay job forms.
