# 268. Installing React Router
Created Saturday 27 August 2022

- React-Router is used to implement client side routing in React apps.
- As of now, there are two main versions: v5 and v6 (latest). v5 is more popular and we'll start with it. We'll also learnt about than migrating to v6, which won't be very different from v5.

[Learning project - React Router Demo](https://github.com/exemplar-codes/react-router-demo)

To use React Router v5, install the `react-router-dom` NPM package (yes `dom` is needed for web apps). We'll install v5:
```bash
npm install react-router-dom@5
```
