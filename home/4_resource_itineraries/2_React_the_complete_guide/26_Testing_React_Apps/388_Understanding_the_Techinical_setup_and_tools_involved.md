# 388. Understanding the Technical setup and tools involved
Created Wednesday 4 January 2023

As mentioned earlier, we need 4 tools:
1. Environment simulator
2. Environment inspector
3. Assertion tool
4. Test runner

We will be using the following tools to test React apps:
1. Vitest/Jest - general purpose JavaScript test runner and assertion library
2. React-Testing-Library - renderer and inspector for React apps

`create-react-app` has both set up by default.
