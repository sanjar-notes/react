# 387. What to Test and How to Test
Created Wednesday 4 January 2023

It is important to have clarity about what we should test and how to do it, from an intention POV.

## What to test
 - For unit tests - have small focused tests that test only one thing, small build blocks like functions/components.

## How to test
- Handle success scenario(s) with clear reason
- Handle error scenario(s) with clear reason
- Handle rare/impossible/out-of-range scenarios with clear reason
