# 396. Summary and Further Resources
Created Sunday 8 January 2023

This module was only an introduction to testing in general and testing React apps specifically.

There are dedicated courses available for testing, testing React apps, and client side testing in general.

Anyway, some resources are useful:
1. Official [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) docs - Jest is a general JavaScript testing tool. Learn more about matchers, async testing, waiting, mocking and more etc.
2. Official [React-Testing-Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) docs - aka RTL, is a testing tool specifically for React apps. Learn more about inspectors, firing user events, async testing, mocking etc. It also has extensions that can be installed with RTL - especially the [React-Hooks-Testing-Library](https://react-hooks-testing-library.com/) extension that is used for testing custom hooks.

It should be a developer goal to test all code in an app.
