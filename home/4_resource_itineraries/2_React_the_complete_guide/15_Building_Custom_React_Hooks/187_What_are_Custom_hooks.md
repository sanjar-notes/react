# 187. What are "Custom Hooks" ?
Created Wednesday 20 July 2022

### Why
Outsource **stateful** logic into **re-usable functions**.
These "custom hooks" can then be used in components.

### What
- Custom hooks are regular hooks which contain stateful logic.
- Unlike regular functions (i.e. non component function), custom hooks *can* use React hooks and state.
