Created Wednesday 20 July 2022

- Custom hooks are a way to re-use logic across components.
- Custom hooks are not something *new*/*non-obvious*. They are just the practice of the DRY principle.

- We have already worked with React hooks, which are important and unique.
- There are 3 rules for hooks in React. The rules are:
	1. Don't call them inside nested functions, i.e. call them only in component functions.
	2. Don't call them in a code block, i.e. they should not be called in conditionals, loops etc.
	3. Can be called inside custom hooks. *This is relevant now*.
