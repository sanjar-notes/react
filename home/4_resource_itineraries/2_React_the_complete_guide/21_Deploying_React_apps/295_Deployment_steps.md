# 295. Deployment steps
Created Saturday 8 October 2022

At the very minimum, we need to:
- Generate the HTML, CSS and JS needed of our app. This is also known as the "build" process for the app.
- Make them accessible through a server.

But, practically, there are more steps needed for a performant deployment. These steps are:
1. Test code - automated or otherwise.
2. Optimize code - make file sizes as small as possible.
3. Build - execute pre-written scripts to generate HTML, CSS and JS.
4. Deploy - place the production files on a server.
5. Configuration - configure the server.
