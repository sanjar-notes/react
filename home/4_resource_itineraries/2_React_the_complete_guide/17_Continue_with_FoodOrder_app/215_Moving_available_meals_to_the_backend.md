# 215. Moving available meals to the backend
Created Tuesday 26 July 2022

- Move the meal list data to the Firebase server, by manually entering the data. Here's the meal list: https://github.com/exemplar-codes/react-meals/blob/abea856489fb0723d5eb407a6dfe6d3f79128cf9/src/components/Meals/AvailableMeals.jsx
- After doing that, populate the meals from the server instead of the hard-coded list. The file is same as above.

Here's the final [code](https://github.com/exemplar-codes/react-meals/commit/d29ba8f2f85e86f524c40591714f7ed572584c99).
