# 214. Module Introduction
Created Tuesday 26 July 2022

Goal: to apply what we learnt in recent module to the [Food Order](https://github.com/exemplar-codes/react-meals) app.
We'll add:
1. Fetch available meals from the backend.
2. Add a checkout/order form, with validation.
3. Submit (i.e. store) the final order to the server.

We'll be using Firebase's Realtime database as a backend. Here's the backend URL:  https://react-http-88257-default-rtdb.asia-southeast1.firebasedatabase.app
