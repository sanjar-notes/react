# 175. Using the Star Wars API
Created Monday 18 July 2022

- Going to learn how to work with HTTP requests using the Star Wars API. We are using a ready made API to keep focus on React, instead of writing a backend app.
- Site: https://swapi.dev/, fallback site: https://swapi.py4e.com/
- This is a read-only REST API that returns JSON data. REST means there are different URLs that are used to access different resources.
