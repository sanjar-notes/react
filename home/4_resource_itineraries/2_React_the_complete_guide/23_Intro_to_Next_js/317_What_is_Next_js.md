# 317. What is Next.js?
Created Tuesday 6 December 2022

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a fullstack(front-end heavy) framework for building large scale web apps.
- [Next.js in 100 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sklc_fQBmcs&ab_channel=Fireship)
- It builds up on React, or in other words, it is React + framework rules + helper libraries to do common tasks needed for "production" scale web apps.
- In short, it eases in the development of React apps. This is because React is not opinionated and so it can be difficult to work with different libraries coherently.
