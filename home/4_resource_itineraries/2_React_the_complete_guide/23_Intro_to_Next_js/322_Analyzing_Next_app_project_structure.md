Three important folders are:
1. `pages` most important. File-based routing is done from here. It also has an `api` folder, which is also a route, but doesn't contain UI components.
2. `public` - static assets like images, icons. It does not have an `index.html`, since it's generated by the SSR process and is different for different routes.
3. `styles` - for style files, optional.
