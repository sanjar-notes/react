# 328. Onwards to a bigger project
Created Wednesday 7 December 2022

We are going to explore Next.js further by working on a more realistic and larger project.

This is a "Meetup" app with venues and their details. Most of the components to be used in pages already exist in the sample project, since they are standard React components and won't help in our exploration of learning Next.

We'll:
1. Store the data in a database and add backend code.
2. Fetch data for a detail page both at time of pre-rendering and in SPA mode.
3. Build APIs for sending/receiving data.
4. Learn how to blend frontend and backend code in Next
   
We'll practice and explore Next.js using this project.
