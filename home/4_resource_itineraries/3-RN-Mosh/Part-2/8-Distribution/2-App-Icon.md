# 2. App Icon
Created Sat Dec 30, 2023 at 1:56 PM

## App icon 
In expo this is very easy to do. just specify it in the `app.json`
- key is `icon`, value is the path
- Image must be in PNG format 
- Size should be 1024 x 1024 
- Avoid round cornered image.
Expo will auto generate the required sized icons for Android and ios, so we don't have to.


## Splash screen 
Same as before, specify in `app.json`
use PNG. Size doesn't matter that much.
