# 11. Coding with redux
Created Sat Dec 30, 2023 at 1:55 PM

We added caching very quickly by overriding axios.
An alternative is to use "redux-persist" to persist the whole Redux store.

This may be needed if the same data needs to be in sync at multiple places in the app.

FIXME: is 'redux-persist' straightforward to do?
