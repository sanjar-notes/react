- React Native is a UI library for building native apps for various platforms with a single codebase.
- Supported target platforms:
	1. Android
	2. iOS
	3. Web
	4. Windows
- RN apps are native apps, not webviews.
	React Native apps are native apps, meaning the app actually uses the environment's components and APIs. Example - for a container view, UIView would be used on iOS, Android.View on Android, and `div` on web.

	In short, an RN apps is not a webview, like Apache Cordova.
