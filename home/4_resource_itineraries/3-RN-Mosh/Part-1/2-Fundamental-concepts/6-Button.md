# 6. Button
Created Wed Nov 15, 2023 at 12:32 AM

- Core component for a button
- This is a cross platform component
- It renders differently, according to the usual Button UI of the platform. This is a good thing.

```jsx
import { Button } from 'react-native';

<Button title="Click me" onPress={(e) => {}}/>
```

- `title="Click me"`
- `onPress`
- `color="blue"`
