# 7. DropdownPicker
Created Tue Dec 5, 2023 at 1:12 AM

There's no RN core component for this.

There are 3 possible UIs here:
1. Dropdown - just like web
2. Slide up menu - is stuck to the bottom, the form becomes a little blurry but the slide up menu has the label and description in it. The user clicks, and the slide up disappears, showing the form with the filled value.
3. Modal, let the user select from a list, and navigate back to the form.

Some people discourage normal drop-down, because long ones can case scrolling or hard to use UX issues.
