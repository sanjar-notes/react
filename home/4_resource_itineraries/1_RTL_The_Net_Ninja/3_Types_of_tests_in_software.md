# 3. Types of tests in software
There are basically 3 kinds of tests:
1. Unit tests - test a piece of code in complete isolation. Examples - class, function, or maybe a focused feature.
2. Integration tests - test if different pieces of the code work together. Example - multiple components associated with a feature.
3. E2E (end to end) tests - test complete user flows. Example - sign in with filling form.

In this tutorial we'll be covering unit tests and integration tests.
