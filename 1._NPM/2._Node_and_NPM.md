# 2. Node and NPM
Created Sunday 19 July 2020

Setting up ``node`` and ``npm``

* Install ``nvm`` - the node version manager.
* Using ``nvm``, install the latest LTS version of ``node``.
* ``npm`` is bundled with ``node``, so no need to install separately.
* Check nvm - run ``nvm list``
* Check node - run ``node -v``
* Check npm - run ``npm -v``



* All the 3 - ``nvm``, ``node``, ``npm`` require admin rights.


*****


* When starting a project, run **npm init** inside the directory.
* Fill the things if you know, or just ignore them.
* A package.json will be created in the directory.
* Start the development.
