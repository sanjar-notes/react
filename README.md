## Why
My needs:
1. Break down UIs into small functions
2. Make my own "HTML components"
3. Don't get bogged down writing glue code
4. Use the latest JS without problems

React provides:
1. A sane way to build apps - specify the frames, without worrying about the transition code.
2. Componentization - break down the UI into small reusable (and manageable) parts
3. Simple [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) - it's like HTML except `{js_expression_here}` is used for including JS logic.
4. Modules - JS, CSS files can be imported seamlessly
5. Stable and simple app constructs
6. Community support + [docs](https://react.dev/) + dev tools (the popularity!)

## How
- React uses a [heuristics-based algorithm](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html) to "figure out" transitions between frames automatically.
- It provides stable and simple app constructs (functions that you can import and use), so app development is practically declarative.

## What

React is a declarative way to build user interfaces.

These are notes (mental models) I made while doing [this Udemy course(released 2020)](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/).

I have tried to compress and classify all information into manageable chunks.

As said earlier, I didn't have a *why*, so the notes may be a little unoptimized. Will try to make them comfortable soon.
