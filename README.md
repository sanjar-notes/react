## Why
Followed the crowds 🙄️

But have recently figured out, that React is a way to *reuse* and *automate* webpage creation.

So using it 🤗️

## How
Just do it!

## What
[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a *library* to *create* and *reuse* your own HTML tags.

These are notes(mental models) I made while doing [this course(2020 version)](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/).

I have tried to compress, and classify all information into manageable chunks.

As said earlier, I didn't have a *why*, so the notes may be a little unoptimized. Will try to make them comfortable soon.

## Usage
Just clone the repo, it's Markdown 🙌.

* TOC
{:toc}
