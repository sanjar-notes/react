## Why
React provides:
1. A sane way to build apps - specify the frames, without worrying about the transition code.
2. Componentization - break down the UI into small reusable (and manageable) parts
3. Simple DSL - it's like HTML except `{js_expression_here}` is used for including JS logic.
4. Modules - JS, CSS files can be imported seamlessly
5. Stable and simple app constructs
6. Community support + docs + dev tools (the popularity!)

## How
- React uses a heuristics-based algorithm to "figure out" transitions between frames automatically.
- It provides stable and simple app constructs (functions that you can import and use), so app development is practically declarative.

## What

React is a declarative way to build user interfaces.

These are notes(mental models) I made while doing [this course(2020 version)](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/).

I have tried to compress and classify all information into manageable chunks.

As said earlier, I didn't have a *why*, so the notes may be a little unoptimized. Will try to make them comfortable soon.
