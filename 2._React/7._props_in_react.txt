====== 7. props in react ======
Created Sunday 06 September 2020

* props are nothing but custom attributes for components.
* Change in prop triggers a render update.
* props are supposed to be read only.
--------------------
* **At component use-side **- they can be named anything, except reserved keywords. Values can be specified directly, but in **{} of course**.

* **How props work in React** - When we specify prop(s) at the use site, a **//props //object** is created(called **props**) by React, which has all the specified attributes. This object is passed as function parameter in the component function, or is set as a data member of the component class. So accessing it is easy.
**At component specification-side** - To access the props, there are three obvious ways:
	a. Using //this.props.propName// - if using class and render() **DON'T USE THIS**
	b. Naming the component function parameter //props//(or anything) and using //props.propName//

	c. Directly destructuring in the function parameter itself.
