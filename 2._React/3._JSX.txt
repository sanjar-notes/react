====== 3. JSX ======
Created Thursday 27 August 2020

* Short for JavaScipt XML
* JSX is not necessary for using React, we could have used basic JS too.
* JSX makes the code intuitive and readable, instead of function calls.
**Rules**
1. Everything is the same as HTML, except reserved keywords like
	* //className// is used instead of //class// for tags
	* //htmlFor// in the HTML label tag instead of the usual //for//.
2. All JS code is to be enclosed in {} when used inside a JSX 
3. All custom tags/components must start with a capital 
4. //style// require an object instead of a string
5. All hyphen separated CSS properties are camelCased
