====== 1. Folder structure ======
Created Thursday 27 August 2020

Files/Folder in order of importance(descending):
1. src - The source folder has all the source files except //index.html//. 
	a. The most important one is **index.js** which is the only requirement to be placed in src/.
	b. App.js is a dummy app that index.js is rendering to **index.html**. This can be removed, but we'll have to change index.js as well.
2. public - this folder has the entry point (index.html). React injects the components into this page.
3. packgage.json - the file with all dependencies etc.

Other files/folders:
* node_modules - This is the file that has all the library modules. It is completely omitted when we push to github
--------------------
How the files work together:

* We can make folders and place things in them, only except index.js.
