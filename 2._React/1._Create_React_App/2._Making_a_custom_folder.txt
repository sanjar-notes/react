====== 2. Making a custom folder ======
Created Tuesday 08 September 2020

* As we saw in the previous page, only index.js is required to be in ''/src''.
* We can create other folders for the files in src.
--------------------
Generally, we use the following folders:
1. components - dumb components
2. containers - smart components
* We keep styles with the JS files.
