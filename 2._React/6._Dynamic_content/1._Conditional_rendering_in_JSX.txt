====== 1. Conditional rendering in JSX ======
Created Thursday 27 August 2020

1. We can use the **ternary** operator for conditional rendering, always in {}
{{./pasted_image001.png}}
{{./pasted_image.png}}
2. We can use &&(i.e shortcircuiting) to render tags. In JS && 
{{./pasted_image002.png}}
	This works because JS **returns** the //second// value as it is(if it is truthy, instead of a boolean). 
	{{./pasted_image003.png}}
	For a ||, the //first// value is **returned** if truthy, else the //second// value.
	{{./pasted_image004.png}}
	* These statement return a value. So in order to avoid return for the function, we wrap these statements in a {}
3. Using if statements
	If we use the return statement, all the successive code is never run. We can avoid this using an extra {}.
	{{./pasted_image005.png}}
4. Using the switch case: similar to if.
--------------------
* Practical examples: In the robofriends App, we can show loading if the URL is still loading.
	{{./pasted_image006.png}}
* Generally, the conditions are kept inside the return clause, using {} JS if possible.
