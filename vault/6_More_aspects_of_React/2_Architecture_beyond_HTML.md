# 2. Architecture beyond HTML

FIXME: what is this ??

The basic architecture of React applies beyond rendering HTML in the browser. For example, Facebook has dynamic charts that render to \<canvas\> [tags](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2013/06/05/why-react.html), and Netflix and PayPal use universal loading to render identical HTML on both the server and client.
