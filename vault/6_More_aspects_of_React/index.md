# 6. More aspects of React
Created Tue Jan 9, 2024 at 1:09 AM

This section will cover libraries and processes used/related to react apps - whether web or mobile. But it will be about important stuff, and not just snippets or minor things like deployment. As least testing/devOps as possible here, for that use Miscellaneous folder for that.
