Created Tue Jan 9, 2024 at 1:09 AM

This section will cover 
- libraries
- processes 
- patterns

that are used/related to react apps - whether web or mobile. 

Note: Only for ideatic tools/processes/patterns, and not just snippets or minor things like deployment. As least testing/devOps as possible here, for that use Miscellaneous folder for that.
