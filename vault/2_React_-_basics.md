# 2. React - basics
Created Monday 20 July 2020

FIXME - why React

* React is a JS library, not a framework.
* React replaced jQuery
* It makes websites scalable and predictable in development.
* It is used by many of the top companies.
* It solves the problem of efficient DOM manipulation.
* React is like a bread-machine, just give the ingredients, and it outputs a website.
* React works with anything - on web, mobile apps, desktop apps, VR apps, etc.

Principles in web dev over the years:

1. Thinking in components
	1. Atoms - Indivisible entities, e.g icons, buttons
	2. Molecules - Navigation bar
	3. Organisms - Functionality
	4. Templates - group of organisms
	5. Pages - The page we see
	* The advantage - We can reuse components to make our pages. No need to rewrite the code.
	* All the components are independent.
2. One way data-flow:
3. Virtual DOM - Handled by React, it is an object which describes our website. Painting is handled in the most optimum way.


#### React.js Alternatives
Angular:

* Is a proper framework
* Uses TypeScript
* Component based
* Batteries included - has most of the extra needed modules set.

React

* Is a UI library
* Component based
* As it is a library, it does not enforce extra needed modules. They may be installed from ``npm``

Vue

* Component based****
* Has many core modules
* From a needed modules POV, it ships with *some* modules, unlike the extremes - React (none) and Angular (most).
