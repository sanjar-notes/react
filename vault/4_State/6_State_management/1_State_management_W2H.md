# 1. State management W2H
Created Monday 30 May 2022

FIXME: 
1. Add that "state management" mostly is about global state management, more so than the generic term.
2. Add what is state management and why it is needed, especially from the resources directory.
3. Discuss in depth the problem of state management in GUI apps, especially web apps. Add a page to https://github.com/sanjar-notes/gui-apps
4. Discuss about Redux. How does it compare with the hook provided for state management?
5. I have a [Redux knowledge repo](https://github.com/sanjar-notes/redux)
