====== 2. React - basics ======
Created Monday 20 July 2020

FIXME - why React
* React is a JS library, not a framework.
* React replaced jQuery
* It makes websites scalable and predictable in development.
* It is used by many of the top companies.
* It solves the problem of efficient DOM manipulation.
* React is like a bread-machine, just give the ingredients, and it outputs a website.
* React works with anything - on web, mobile apps, desktop apps, VR apps, etc.

Principles in web dev over the years:
1. Thinking in components
	a. Atoms - Indivisible entities, e.g icons, buttons
	b. Molecules - Navigation bar
	c. Organisms - Functionality
	d. Templates - group of organisms
	e. Pages - The page we see
	* The advantage - We can reuse components to make our pages. No need to rewrite the code.
	* All the components are independent.
2. One way data-flow:
3. Virtual DOM - Handled by React, it is an object which describes our website. Painting is handled in the most optimum way.

=== React.js Alternatives ===
Angular:
	* Is a proper framework
	* Uses TypeScript
	* Component based
	* Batteries included - has most of the extra needed modules set.
React
	* Is a UI library
	* Component based
	* As it is a library, it does not enforce extra needed modules. They may be installed from ''npm''
Vue
	* Component based
	* Has many core modules
	* From a needed modules POV, it ships with //some// modules, unlike the extremes - React (none) and Angular (most).
